        "content": "<p>Understanding the common causes of underground drain clogs in Marietta homes can help you prevent costly repairs and maintain a healthy plumbing system. As experienced drain cleaning professionals serving <a href='/marietta-service-areas/west-cobb-30064'>West Cobb</a> and surrounding areas, we've seen it all. Here's your comprehensive guide to underground drain problems and solutions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Tree Root Infiltration</h2>\n<p>Marietta's beautiful tree-lined streets can pose challenges for underground drains. Tree roots naturally seek water sources and can penetrate pipe joints, creating severe blockages. Regular <a href='/services/sewer-line-descaling-and-cleaning-marietta-ga'>sewer line descaling and cleaning</a> can prevent major issues.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Grease and Fat Accumulation</h2>\n<p>Commercial and residential kitchen waste often contains fats that solidify in pipes. This is particularly common in restaurants near the Marietta Square. Regular <a href='/services/grease-trap-pumping-marietta-drain-cleaning'>grease trap pumping</a> is essential for preventing buildups.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Foreign Object Blockages</h2>\n<p>Items that shouldn't go down drains often end up there anyway, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Baby wipes and paper towels</li>\n<li>Children's toys</li>\n<li>Hygiene products</li>\n<li>Construction debris</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>4. Soil Displacement and Pipe Settling</h2>\n<p>Georgia's clay-rich soil can shift, especially during heavy rains, causing pipe misalignment. This is common in older neighborhoods like <a href='/marietta-service-areas/vinings-30339'>Vinings</a> and requires professional inspection.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Scale and Mineral Buildup</h2>\n<p>Marietta's hard water can lead to mineral deposits in pipes. Our <a href='/services/high-pressure-drain-jetting-marietta-ga-30060'>high-pressure drain jetting</a> service effectively removes these buildups.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Outdoor Debris Accumulation</h2>\n<p>Leaves, mulch, and yard waste can clog outdoor drainage systems.
